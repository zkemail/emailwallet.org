This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) describes  how Email Wallet (“we”, “us” or “our”) collects, uses, and shares data in connection with the Email Wallet web app (emailwallet.org) and all of our other properties, products, and services (the “Services”). Your use of the Services is subject to this Policy as well as our Terms of Service.

<p>
High Level Summary
</p>
<ul>

<li>Email Wallet is a set of smart contracts deployed on Layer 1 and Layer 2 chains.

<li>Email Wallet does not collect or store personal data, such as first name, last name, street address, date of birth, email address, or IP address, in connection with your use of the Services.

<li>Email Wallet optionally allows relayers to read select user emails. This enables an improved user experience in generating ZK proofs. Before any data is sent to Email Wallet’s proving servers, user consent is explicitly requested. Only data explicitly approved by the user will be sent to Email Wallet’s servers for proof generation. At no point is any user data persisted on Email Wallet’s servers.

<li>Email Wallet may explore methods to further protect consumers' privacy, such as opt-out prompts, migrating to privacy-centric tooling and deploying proxies to anonymize network traffic.

<li>Users are empowered to explore client-side privacy techniques and tools.

<li>Any material changes to privacy will be reflected in an updated privacy policy and posted to emailwallet.org.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Data We Collect
</p>
<p>
Privacy is central to everything we do at the Company. And we've enshrined transparency as one of our Company values. Accordingly, we aspire to be transparent about what little data we do collect. We do not maintain user accounts and do not store personal data, such as your name or internet protocol (“IP”) address.
</p>
<p>
If we receive any communications and information you provide directly to us via email, customer support, social media, or another support channel (such as Twitter or Telegram), or when you participate in any surveys or questionnaires, that data may be persisted on Email Wallet’s servers.
</p>
<p>
If you specifically provide us with information (such as an email for proof generation), we may use that information for the purposes described when you provide it to us. After a proof has been generated, the information is not persisted on Email Wallet’s servers. We will not attempt to link any information you provide to your wallet address, IP address, or other personal data. You do not need to provide us with any personal data to use the Services.
</p>
